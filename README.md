# Python WhatsApp Chatbot with Dynamic PDFs

This is a Python-based WhatsApp chatbot designed for businesses that need to deliver personalized and interactive content to their users. It uses the Meta (Facebook) Graph API to interact with users, providing them with project information, marketing materials, and a way to connect with a support assistant.

The core of this project is its ability to dynamically "stamp" a user's name and phone number onto a template PDF document, creating a personalized experience for each user.
